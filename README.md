# image-matcher-backend
A Hack the Midlands project.
## Brief description
This is a web application that allows users to click on a random image from a slideshow and then be shown a list of similar images. The images are stored in a database and the similarity is determined by PHash. A painting can receive likes and the more likes it receives the more it is shown to users.


This is the back end version. The Front end: https://github.com/mgsium/image-matcher-frontend
